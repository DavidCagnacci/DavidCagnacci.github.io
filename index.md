<div style="text-align: center"><h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1></div>

Game development and software programming are my passions. With over five years of study and two years of professional experience in these fields, I am well-equipped to take on any challenges that are thrown my way.

Flexibility and adaptability are my greatest strengths, and I have previous experience in many languages, engines and technologies - especially Unity, C# and C++. I'm happiest when working on the engines and tools used to create amazing interactive experiences.
