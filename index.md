<div class="portrait"><img src="assets/img/portrait.png" alt="David Cagnacci"></div>

Game development and software programming are my passions. With over five years of study in these fields, I am well-equipped to take on any challenges that are thrown my way.

Flexibility and adaptability are my greatest strengths, while my previous experience mostly resides in C++, C# and Unity. I greatly enjoy working with artificial intelligence, shaders and procedural generation due to the virtually unlimited possibilities these technologies make possible.
